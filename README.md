# Predicting-Solar-Power-Output-Using-Linear-Regression
This project aims to develop a machine learning model using linear regression to accurately predict solar power output based on various environmental factors such as temperature, sunlight intensity, humidity, and time of day. By leveraging historical data and advanced analytical techniques, the model provides a reliable solution for optimizing energy generation and improving solar panel efficiency. The project demonstrates the practical application of AI/ML in renewable energy management.
